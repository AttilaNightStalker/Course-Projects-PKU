In this project, a semantic parser that parse a question sentence into certain semantic form is trained with sample sentences and its standard representation of its logical structure. It's quite a challenging problem because what should be learned by the program is not a map from an array of numerical data to another array of numerical data, but map from a unformulated structrual data to another formulated structural data. 
Our professors didn't encourage us to implement neuro network method. I dealt with such a problem with my self designed algorithm. It is rudimentary due to the limit of time to do this project, but I believe that it can be improved somehow.
